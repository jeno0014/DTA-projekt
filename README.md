This project simulates a library where visitors can borrow books. 
There are only two books available, and one copy of each, in this library and the visitors has to get in a queue before they can borrow it.
Each book workes like servers and there is one queue for each book.
The simulation log and view the results of how long the visitors waits (average, maximum and minimum).

It alsow shows the statistics for the system stability. 
By changing the "LOAN_DURATION" (how long the visitors can loan the book), the system stability changes aswell.

The simulation uses SimPy and follows a M/M/1 Queue Statistic.
